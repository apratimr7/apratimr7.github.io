I am a Physics hons and Philosophy minor final year undergrad student at the Thapar School of Liberal Arts and Sciences. I am deeply interested in the fundamental question of theoretical physics, philosophy of physics, and metaphysics. Looking for opportunities to work on interesting projects and improve my research skills. 

I also like to explore and learn about new technologies, neuroscience, AI, and Consiousness, etc.

I am also a lead guitarist and a music ethusiast. Heavily inspired by bands like Dream Theatre, Periphery, Born of Osiris, etc, I like to write technical riffs and leads. Apart from guitar, I also like to play piano, but I am not good at it.
